Comments regarding the mathematical model in our former approach:

First, in the solutions presented we only have been looking to create an arc between emitters into sorage, and  utilization sites.
Secondly, this model does not take into account that two emitters can be very close, and instead of building a pipeline that goes from emitter 1 to emitter 2 and together to the storage, the model will suggest, we build two different pipelines.
  Say the emitters were in a tringular position between each other, and then we would have a huge cost to pay for such model. 

Next, if we were to considder the emitters and all utilizers as recieverers as well, then the problem becomes too big with having over 5900 decision variables. Gurobi can only handle 2000 on a free academic license 
I propose to tweak the approach for the whole countries by doing a "neighbohood search" first, and then solve the problem in terms of.

  Emitter 1 will search for the closest storage site, and if that does not have the capacity to have all the emissions, then we outsorce the CO2 into other sources. 
  When solving the entire countries scenario, we must consider/assume that a country will only take CO2 to store, if they have capacity, and we include a different price for storing it (now the storage is consider more of a utilization point)

So, first solve the whole countries one by one, 
save the numbers on the amount of CO2 that is "leaking"
Include that CO2 into the trading market internationally, and make one or two trading points for them.
